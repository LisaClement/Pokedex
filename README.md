<h1> pokedex </h1> 

<h3> Description </h3>
This app fetches data from the pokeAPI https://pokeapi.co/ and displays a list of Pokemon that have been fetched (151 in total). Each pokemon has its own button which can be clicked on. When doing so, a modal window will open, displaying additional information about the pokemon, as for example its picture, height, weigh and type (grass, fire, water, etc.). The window with the additional information can be closed by either pressing the escape button, clicking outside the window, or by using the close button of the modal.
